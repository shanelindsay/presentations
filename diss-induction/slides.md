## Precision or Gist? How the mind compresses new words

When you learn a new word, when do you store fine detail, and when do you compress it into a gist that helps you generalise?
- Detail helps you tell similar words apart
- Compression helps you use what you learned with new examples (allows generalisation)
- Your project will test what pushes the system toward detail or toward gist

## Compression and clinical relevance
- Threat Generalisation & Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU - IUS‑12)
- Over general memory bias & depression 
- Sleep - quality/disruption impacts

## AI and education
- How do you learn to work with AI's that are super-smart?
- Future of work and "agents" - what skills will undergrads need to develop?
- Quantitative skills - using AI for stats

## AI and qualitative
- Becoming the Manager: Identity & Agency - "How does delegating analysis change feelings of competence, ownership, and responsibility?"
- Ethics & Authorship in Agent‑Assisted Work - Where do students draw authorship and responsibility lines across gradations of assistance??
