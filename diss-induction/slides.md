## Precision or Gist? How the mind compresses new words

### Big question:
When you learn a new word, when do you store fine detail, and when do you compress it into a gist that helps you generalise?
- Detail helps you tell similar words apart
- Compression helps you use what you learned with new examples
- Your project will test what pushes the system toward detail or toward gist
